      - title: Help me dedicate my time to the people that appreciate it the most - the Hip Op-eration dance crew.  My goal is to be able to give them two full days of my time per week, and I need your help to pull this off. 
        content: When the Christchurch earthquake hit, I was in the city on a lunch break from my corporate job. In that twenty seconds, I had a lightbulb moment that would change my life in a way I could never have imagined. I said to myself that if I survived the quake, I'd quit my job, move to Waiheke Island, and start living a more meaningful life.<br/><br/>Well, I survived! I kept my side of the bargain, and that's how Hip Op-eration Crew was formed. I teach hip-hop dance to a group of 22 elderly people here on Waiheke Island. The average age of my dancers is 80, but they've got more zest for life than any other people I know. I dedicate as much time as I can to teaching them, but because it's unpaid, I have to work a full time job too in order to be able to pay my rent. With Circawork I hope to be able to pay myself for the hours I spend teaching, and be able to reduce my hours in the office. I'd love to spend two days a week with my dancers, and the big dream is to be able to make this my one and only job!<br/><br/>Will you help me take the first step?
